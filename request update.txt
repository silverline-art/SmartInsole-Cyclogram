in one graph

stacking must be
sub-plot 1 : left foot complete
sub-plot 2 : right foot complete
subplot 2 is stacked below subplot 1


and why the mean_cyclograms; symmetry where are the relevant plots

also globally the cyclograms are closed loops so all of the answer must be in the closed loop and the stance and swing phase and all of the subphase must be on all of the plots on the loop
and also create the summary subplot on each plots about the
curvature; smoothness and area and related parameters of the cyclogram analysis with std
