Desired output:
output_dir: "/home/shivam/Desktop/Human_Pose/PROJECT CYCLOGRAM/DATA ANALYSIS Script/data_output"
plots png and output csv for the data and make sure all of the  parameters are recognized and are used in the cluster (excluding: Dataset; Patient Name; Patient ID; Fracture Site; Fracture Name (as they are sample information not data))
in first there must be following plots

cluster plot with outliers marked with different color and Fracture Site [Lt (Red color) and Rt (Blue color) must be labelled]
- cluster plot for ACC_3D cyclogram metrics
- cluster plot for ACC_XY cyclogram metrics
- cluster plot for ACC_XZ cyclogram metrics
- cluster plot for ACC_YZ cyclogram metrics
- cluster plot for ACC_3D gait metrics
- cluster plot for ACC_XY gait metrics
- cluster plot for ACC_XZ gait metrics
- cluster plot for ACC_YZ gait metrics

The output csv only contains the information about the
Dataset; Patient Name; Patient ID; Fracture Site; Fracture Name; Cluster No.; Outlier (Y/N)
